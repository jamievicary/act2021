	<p><b>Latest Updates</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>21 April.</b> <a href="#registration">Online registration now open.</a></li>
</ul>
	
<p>The <i>4th International Conference on Applied Category Theory</i> 
will take place at the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge
on 12-16 July 2021, preceded by the
Adjoint School 2021 on 5-9 July. This conference follows previous events at
<a href="http://act2020.mit.edu/">MIT</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ACT2019/">Oxford</a>
and
<a href="https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops/">Leiden</a>.</p>

<p>The conference will be a hybrid event, with physical attendees present
in Cambridge, and other participants taking part online. Due to the need for
	physical distancing, the number of in-person registrations will be
	limited, so please don't book your travel or accommodation
	until your registration is confirmed.</p>

<p>Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of
researchers, interested in studying many different kinds of systems using
category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science,
mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics, cognition,
and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members is as varied as
the systems being studied. The goal of Applied Category Theory is to bring
researchers in the field together, disseminate the latest results, and
facilitate further development of the field.</p>
	
<p>We accept contributions across the pure-applied spectrum, from
pure mathematical research, to case studies describing successful
application of category-theoretic tools in industry. However,
submissions at the most mathematical end should take care to explain
how this work could be applied to a subject outside of pure category
theory itself, while submissions at the most applied end should
contain a clear explanation of the category theory involved.</p>

<p>To accommodate the publishing conventions of different fields,
we accept submissions of both original research papers, and also work
	accepted/submitted/published elsewhere. Accepted original
	research papers will be invited for publication in a proceedings volume.
The keynote addresses will be drawn from the best accepted papers. The conference will include an
industry showcase event.</p>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

	<p>All dates are in 2021, and all deadlines are

	<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
	
	<p>Registration for online participation is free, and is now open at the following link. Registering for online participation does not
	prevent you registering at a later date for physical participation if you would like to do that.</p>
	
	<ul><li><a href="https://forms.gle/KENNAbk6iLwqJ7i36">Registration Form for Online Participation</a></li></ul>
	
	<p>Priority registration for physical participants opened on Wednesday 9 June. In this priority period, registration is restricted
	to speakers, sponsors, and those who have been awarded financial support. Ordinary physical registration opens on Friday 11 June.
	The total number of physical registrations will be restricted to allow for social distancing during the conference.</p>
	
	<h2>Local Information</h2>
	
	<p><b><i>Current UK government projections indicate that physical conference participation will be allowed
		for the conference dates. However, there of course remains a possibility that circumstances may change, and the organizers
		may reluctantly decide to cancel the physical confence due to circumstances related to the pandemic.
		If the physical conference is cancelled, any money paid for registration would be refunded.
		However, the organizers will not be liable for any other costs that physical
		participants may have, such as travel or accommodation costs. If you are not willing to take
		this risk, we suggest you plan to participate online.</i></b></p>
	
	<p>The physical conference will take place at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. Information about travel will follow soon.</p>
	
	<!--<p>Official conference accommodation will be available for priority booking by physical participants at a College of the university.
		The deadline for booking this official accommodation is Monday 14 June. The booking code will only be made available to
		those who have registered as a physical participant.
		The number of available accommodation rooms matches the number of registration slots, so if you have successfully
		registered for physical participation, you are guaranteed to be able to book accommodation, as long as you do so
		before the deadline. In the unfortunate event that the physical conference is cancelled
		due to COVID, the cost of this physical accommodation will be fully refunded.</p>-->
	
	<p>For those with a confirmed in-person registration, accommodation in Cambridge can be booked through the usual
	websites. In particular we recommend <a href="http://www.universityrooms.com">http://www.universityrooms.com</a>,
	as a source of good-value accommodation, and suggest Fitzwilliam College as a low-priced option which is
	conveniently located close to both the conference location and the city centre.
	</p>
	
	<p>The physical conference will be organized in a COVID-safe way. In particular, participants will be expected to observe
	social distancing, the number of participants will be restricted, seating in the lecture theatre will be well-spaced,
	coffee and lunch breaks will be outdoors where possible, and masks will be required while not eating or drinking.</p>
	
<h2>Accepted Presentations</h2>

<p>The following 50 submissions have been accepted for presentation at ACT 2021. A full programme will be available closer
	to the conference dates. The suffix "(D)" indicates the submission has been selected for a distinguished presentation.

<h2>Programme</h2>

There will be a single track of talks, given live by speakers, either online or in-person.
All talks will be visible by both online and in-person participants. The scientific programme is not yet available.

<h2>Financial Support</h2>
<p><i>Financial support applications have now closed.</i></p>
<p>Some financial support is available to support attendance by junior researchers who would like to attend the conference in person.
To apply for this, send an email to Lukas Heidemann at <a href="mailto:lukas.heidemann@cs.ox.ac.uk">lukas.heidemann@cs.ox.ac.uk</a>
	from an academic email address, with subject line "ACT 2021 Financial Support Application".</p>
<p>In your email, please give the following
information: your name and affiliation; an estimate of the total cost for you to attend; the amount you are requesting;
whether or not you have had a paper accepted to the conference (and if so, its submission number); and whether you have secured or applied for
partial funding from another source (if so, this will strengthen your application). Also, please give a brief statement about why you believe that COVID restrictions
will not prevent you from attending (e.g. "I live in the UK, and current government projections indicate no restrictions on
	conference travel and participation in July".)</p>
<p>You will be informed about the result of your application on <del>Tuesday 8 June</del> Wednesday 9 June. Successful applicants for financial
support will be eligible for the Priority Physical Registration period, which opens on Wednesday 9 June.</p>
	
<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p><i>Submission via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=act20210">EasyChair</a> is now closed.</i></p>

<p>There are two submission tracks, both of which will be reviewed against the same standards of quality.
Submission of work-in-progress is encouraged, but it must be more substantial than a
research proposal.
<ul>
<li> <i>Proceedings Track.</i>  Original contributions of high-quality work
consisting of an extended summary, up to 12 pages excluding bibliography, that provides evidence of
results of genuine interest, and with enough detail to allow the program
committee to assess the merits of the work. Full proofs of mathematical
	statements are not necessarily required. Accepted submissions in
	this track will be invited for publication
	in a proceedings volume. Submissions to this track must be prepared with LaTeX, using the EPTCS style
	files available at <a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a>. Additional appendices 
	beyond the page limit are
	permitted but may not be read by reviewers, and will not be included in the proceedings.
</li>
<li> <i>Non-Proceedings Track.</i> Submissions presenting high-quality work submitted or
published elsewhere, or for which publication in the proceedings is not desired by
	the authors, may be submitted to this track, provided the work is recent
and relevant to the conference. The work may be of any length, but the
program committee members may only look at the first 3 pages of the
submission, so you should ensure that these pages contain sufficient
evidence of the quality and rigour of your work.
</li>
</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Since ACT is an interdisciplinary conference, we use two
tracks to accommodate the publishing conventions of different
disciplines. For example, those from a Computer Science background may
prefer the Proceedings Track, while those from a Mathematics, Physics
or other background may prefer the Non-Proceedings Track. However,
authors from any background are free to choose the track that they
prefer, and submissions may be moved from the Proceedings Track to the
		Non-Proceedings Track at any time at the request of the authors.</p>

<h2>Adjoint School</h2>

<i>Applications for the Adjoint School 2021 are now closed.</i>

<p>The Adjoint School is an annual collaborative research event, in which junior researchers work on cutting-edge
	topics in applied category theory, guided by expert mentors. Traditionally, after a four month reading course,
	the participants meet at the venue of the ACT conference for a week of in-person research collaborator. Due to
	the pandemic, this year the research week will be held online. The students will share the results of their
	research in a special session during the ACT conference.</p>

	<p>For more information see the <a href="http://adjointschool.com">official school website</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Statement of Values</h2>
	
	The organizers hope that the Applied Category Theory community can be a positive force in the world. To help us
	achieve this, we have drafted a <a href="http://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/statement-of-values/">Statement of Values</a>,
	which we ask all participants to uphold.
